A blessing in disguise
A hot potato
A penny for your thoughts
Actions speak louder than words
Add insult to injury
Against the clock
All ears
An arm and a leg
At a loss
Back to the drawing board
Ball is in your court
Barking up the wrong tree
Beat around the bush
Best of both worlds
Bite off more than you can chew
Blessing in disguise
Burn the midnight oil
Can't judge a book by its cover
Caught between two stools
Costs an arm and a leg
Cry over spilt milk
Curiosity killed the cat
Cut corners
Cutting corners
Devil's advocate
Don't count your chickens before they hatch
Don't put all your eggs in one basket
Don't put the cart before the horse
Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater
Don't try to teach your grandmother to suck eggs
Down to earth
Draw the line
Fit as a fiddle
Get a taste of your own medicine
Get over it
Give someone the cold shoulder
Go back to the drawing board
Go down in flames
Go the extra mile
Good things come to those who wait
Hang in there
Hit the nail on the head
In the same boat
It takes two to tango
Jump on the bandwagon
Keep your chin up
Kick the bucket
Kill two birds with one stone
Last straw
Let sleeping dogs lie
Let the cat out of the bag
Like riding a bike
Make a long story short
Method to my madness
Miss the boat
No pain no gain
Off the hook
On the ball
Once in a blue moon
On thin ice
Out of the blue
Pull someone's leg
Pulling your leg
Put something on ice
Rain cats and dogs
Raining cats and dogs
Rise and shine
Rome wasn't built in a day
Rub someone the wrong way
Saved by the bell
Shape up or ship out
Shake a leg
Shooting fish in a barrel
Sitting on the fence
Sleep on it
Slow and steady wins the race
Speak of the devil
Spill the beans
Stab someone in the back
Start from scratch
Steal someone's thunder
Take it with a grain of salt
The ball is in your court
The best of both worlds
The last straw
The sky's the limit
The straw that broke the camel's back
The whole nine yards
There's no such thing as a free lunch
Think outside the box
Third time's the charm
Through thick and thin
Throw in the towel
Time flies by fast
to be all ears
to be broke
to be fed up with
to be in hot water
to be in the same boat
to be nuts about
to be sick and tired of
to be up to someone
to blow one's mind
to break the ice
to call it a day
to catch someone's eye
to cost an arm and a leg
to cut corners
to cut to the chase
to drive someone up the wall
to feel blue
to feel under the weather
to get a kick out of
to get cold feet
to get the ball rolling
to give someone a hand
to go back to the drawing board
to have a sweet tooth
to hit the hay
to hit the nail on the head
to hold one's horses
to keep an eye on
to keep one's chin up
to kill two birds with one stone
to let the cat out of the bag
to make a long story short
to miss the boat
to not see eye to eye
to pass the buck
to play it by ear
to pull someone's leg
to put all one's eggs in one basket
to put one's foot in one's mouth
to put up with
to rain cats and dogs
to ring a bell
to rock the boat
to sit tight
to smell a rat
to spill the beans
to take the bull by the horns
to take with a grain of salt
to tie the knot
to turn over a new leaf
to twist someone's arm
to walk on eggshells
to work one's fingers to the bone
to work out
to you get the picture
